# Simon-Piano-Game

Simon's Piano Game is a "follow the leader" memory game played on a virtual piano keyboard. Click "start" to start the game. Simon's piano will play a note. If you successfully play back the note on the piano keyboard using your keyboard (or mouse), Simon will add a new note to the sequence for you to duplicate. There are 10 levels, can you make it through all 10?

About the Making of this Game

This game was built using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript and tested on Chrome.

I started with building the piano keyboard itself in HTML5 and CSS. Once the virtual piano resembled a working piano I began working on the piano's functionality in Javascript. The piano sounds were taken from google drive of piano key sounds tied to letters on the keyboard (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HISRomgGs_XEpCzBuBLfNsYT19ULyGlT/view). I created two JS files; (1) script.js for functionalilty and free play of the virtual piano, and (2) game.js for the game logic. 

Future planned updates for the project include:

* adding song theme options that players can select to learn how to play a song on the piano.
* adding a counter to the screen so players can track progress while they are playing the game.
* exploring options for the sound files to improve processing when playing the game online.
